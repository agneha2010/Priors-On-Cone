Contents

final_code/NHANES_analysis

This folder contains the analysis of the NHANES data. The example used in the paper is in the folder "log_transformed_new_constraints_with_zeros". The main code is "run_all_together.R" that uses two functions in the main folder - "fittingCompoSpikeFinal - Mixed effect Data.R" and "fittingCompo - Mixed effect Data.R".

final_code/strong_sparse

This folder contains the simulation code when the parameter vector is sparse. The final code is "final_code/strong_sparse/fianl_run/strong_sparse_run_all_together.R" which uses two functions in the main folder - "fittingCompoSpikeFinal - Mixed effect.R" and "fittingCompo - Mixed effect.R".

final_code/dense

This folder contains the simulation code when the parameter vector is dense. The final code is "final_code/dense/final_run/dense_run_all_together.R" which uses two functions in the main folder - "fittingCompoSpikeFinal - Mixed effect.R" and "fittingCompo - Mixed effect.R".
